# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Provide a professional Financial Health Check-Up questionnaire with yes/no answers, instant score-based results, and a WhatsApp contact page for requesting a review.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a responsive questionnaire page that renders exactly 10 provided questions, each answerable only via Yes/No controls.
- Disable Submit until all 10 questions are answered; on submit, calculate the total “Yes” score and display “Your score: X/10” plus the correct result band: 0–5 Critical Zone, 6–7 Need to review your financial plan, 8–9 Good, 10 Secure.
- Allow users to change answers and re-submit (or update results) to see updated scoring.
- Add navigation to a dedicated Contact page/section with English copy offering a financial health review and a “Contact Now” button linking to https://wa.me/918829921156.
- Apply branding and theme: use a local background image behind the main layout and show an Axis Max Life logo (kept in aspect ratio), with a cohesive professional finance/insurance theme that avoids a blue+purple primary palette.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can complete a 10-question yes/no financial check-up, submit to instantly see their score and status, and navigate to a Contact page to open WhatsApp chat to request a review.
